Overview
-------------
This script enables to use cscope with quickfix.

Preparation
-----------------
You must prepare cscope and cscope database (cscope.out file).
cscope is a tag tool like ctags, but unlike ctags, it is a cross referencing tool.
If you don't know about cscope see:
:help cscope
http://cscope.sourceforge.net/
http://iamphet.nm.ru/cscope/ (Win32)

Feature 1
--------------
This script adds a command ":Cscope", which is very similar to ":cscope find" command. But, this ":Cscope" command can be used with quickfix, and isn't needed cscope connection. So, you don't have to install vim with --enable-cscope.

--------------
This script adds keymap macro as follows:
<C-\> s: Find this C symbol
<C-\> g: Find this definition
<C-\> d: Find functions called by this function
<C-\> c: Find functions calling this function
<C-\> t: Find this text string
<C-\> e: Find this egrep pattern
<C-\> f: Find this file
<C-\> i: Find files #including this file
"this" means <cword> or <cfile> on the cursor.

Feature 3
--------------
This script adds Tools and Popup menu as follows:
"Symbols": Find this C symbol
"Defines": Find this definition
"Calls": Find functions called by this function
"Globals": Find functions calling this function
"Texts": Find this text string
